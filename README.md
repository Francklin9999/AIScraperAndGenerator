# AIScraperAndGenerator

AI-Driven ImageScrape is a web application built with Streamlit that uses AI to extract information from websites and generate images based on the scraped content. The tool offers two input methods: scraping content from a website URL or using a text description provided by the user. The application processes the scraped or entered data, allowing users to view and refine the content before parsing it with AI. Additionally, users can choose to generate an image based on the parsed content, creating visual representations of the extracted information. This program is ideal for those looking to quickly visualize data extracted from web sources using AI technology.
